# :robot: Build a Chapstick Flashlight

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

Soldering is a skill that takes practice.  This assignment will allow you to have some fun practicing soldering.  In the end you will have a pushbutton flashlight made from a chapstick tube.üöÄ

## Preparation

You will need the following items:
- ChapStick Tube
- Tactile Switch
- A23 Battery (12V)
- 470-Ohm Resistor
- 10mm White LED (28,500mcd, 20mA, 3.5V)
- Solder
- Heat Shrink Tubing
- Wire
- "N" Battery Holder
- Epoxy and/or super glue

1. Remove the Chapstick from the tube and remove the bottom piece and screw from the tube assembly.
2. Cut 60 mm of the chapstick off the may body and set it aside.
3. Clip off two of the leads from the tactile switch diagonally opposite to each other.

## Soldering the LED to the Resistor
1. Cut the cathode of the LED to 60 mm.
2. Solder the resistor to the cathode 
3. Shrink some heat shrink tubing over it.
4. Push both leads through the top of the ChapStick platform.

## Complete the top section
1. Cut the spring from the "N" battery holder (leaving the plastic portion it's attached to intact)
2. Insert the 60 mm section of the battery holder with the spring attached into the bottom of the platform (this will help to make the base of the spring more stable.) 
3. Slide the positive lead of the LED through the center of the spring. 
4. solder it to the base of the spring and then clip any remaining portion of the lead off.

## Build the Switch Base
1. Cut a square in the bottom portion large enough to put the tactile switch through. 
2. Position the switch to where the button sticks out just slightly past the bottom. 
3. After it's in place, Epoxy the back side (the portion that goes up into the tube). 
4. After the Epoxy dries, you can trim it up with a razor blade.

## Wiring the Switch

## Final Assimbly

## üìù Next steps
In order to complete the assighment, take a video of the working flashlight (mp4 or mov file type).  Create a new markdown file which describes, in your own words, how you think this flashlight works.  Use the technique in the video below, embed your video in the file so I can see your working flashlight.
